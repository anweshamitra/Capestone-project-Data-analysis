World Population Data Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project involves analyzing world population data for the years 2020-2029 and 2030-2040 using SQL Server for data storage and retrieval, and Python with Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization. The project aims to gain insights into population trends and distributions across different locations, age groups, and genders.

Data Description
The dataset contains population information with the following columns:

Time: The year of the data.
Location: The geographical location.
AgeGrp: The age group.
Male_population: The male population count.
Female_population: The female population count.
PopTotal: The total population count.
Project Structure
Data Storage:

The population data is stored in an SQL Server database for efficient querying and management.
SQL scripts are provided to create and populate the database tables.
Data Analysis:

Jupyter Notebooks are used to analyze and visualize the population data.
Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib are utilized for data manipulation and plotting.
Visualization:

Various types of plots (bar charts, pie charts, line charts) are created to represent the population data.
The visualizations help in understanding the population distribution and trends over the years.
Requirements
Software:
SQL Server
Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.x
Python Libraries:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
sqlalchemy (for SQL Server connection)
Setup Instructions
SQL Server Setup:

Install SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Use the provided SQL script create_tables.sql to create the database and tables.
Use the provided SQL script populate_tables.sql to populate the tables with the population data.
Jupyter Notebook Setup:

Install Jupyter Notebook.
Install the required Python libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib sqlalchemy
Running the Notebooks:

Open Jupyter Notebook.
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Open and run the provided notebooks to perform data analysis and visualization.
Notebooks
Data_Loading_and_Cleaning.ipynb:

Load the data from the SQL Server database into a pandas DataFrame.
Clean the data by removing rows with 'no data' and handling missing values.
Data_Analysis.ipynb:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the population data.
Generate summary statistics and basic visualizations.
Population_Visualization.ipynb:

Create various plots to visualize the population data.
Include bar charts, pie charts, and line charts to represent different aspects of the data.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of world population data over two decades, utilizing the power of SQL Server for data storage and Python for analysis and visualization. The insights gained from this analysis can help in understanding demographic trends and informing policy decisions.
